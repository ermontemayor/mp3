Question 1: This is a duplicated code smell, to refactor I extracted the code into a new function
which removed the smell and I was able to still run all the tests.

Question 2: No written answer, commited and pushed q2

Question 3: This is a feature envy code smell where the code wishes it were in another class.
To remove the code smell I just moved it to the appropriate class.
